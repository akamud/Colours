Colours
================

Colours is a port of the Colours Library for iOS made by [**Ben Gordon**](https://github.com/bennyguitar). You can find that project [**here**](https://github.com/bennyguitar/Colours). 
This is also based on the Java port by [**Matthew York**](https://github.com/MatthewYork) found [**here**](https://github.com/MatthewYork/Colours).

I just started this project as a way to have this on Xamarin Platforms, right now I'm focusing on the Xamarin.Android port. I plan to port it to Xamarin.Forms later. Since I don't own neither a Xamarin.iOS license or a Mac, I don't have any plans to port this to Xamarin.iOS. If you can contribute to that, I'll happily accept pull requests.
