{"name":"Colours","tagline":"A beautiful set of predefined colors and a set of color methods to make your Xamarin.Android development life easier.","body":"Colours\r\n================\r\n\r\n![Colours](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akamud/Colours/master/images/colours.png)\r\n\r\nColours is a port of the Colours Library for iOS made by [**Ben Gordon**](https://github.com/bennyguitar). You can find that project [**here**](https://github.com/bennyguitar/Colours). \r\nThis is also based on the Java port by [**Matthew York**](https://github.com/MatthewYork) found [**here**](https://github.com/MatthewYork/Colours).\r\n\r\nI just started this project as a way to have this on Xamarin Platforms, right now I'm focusing on the Xamarin.Android port. I plan to port it to Xamarin.Forms later. Since I don't own neither a Xamarin.iOS license or a Mac, I don't have any plans to port this to Xamarin.iOS. If you can contribute to that, I'll happily accept pull requests.\r\n\r\n## Android Sample\r\n\r\nThe Android Sample contains various examples of how to use Colours in your project. You can also see the Color Palette available.\r\n\r\n![Android Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akamud/Colours/master/images/androidsample_screenshot_compressed.png)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* [**Matthew York**](https://github.com/MatthewYork) - Author of Colours for Android \r\n* [**Ben Gordon**](https://github.com/bennyguitar) - Author of original iOS version of Colours\r\n\r\n## License\r\n[MIT License](https://github.com/akamud/Colours/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
